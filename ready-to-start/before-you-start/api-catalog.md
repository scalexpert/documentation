# API catalog

{% hint style="info" %}
API reference documentation is available in this guide [here](broken-reference).
{% endhint %}

### Why choosing a catalog

API catalogs are like menus in restaurant. You will need to choose one accordingly to your demand and context. For testing purpose before go-live, choose "UATC[^1]". UATC catalog is identical to PRODUCTION (same APIs) but a different keys would need to be subscribed for testing.

Thus, as a customer you would have two keys :key: one for tests (UATC) and another for production (PROD).&#x20;

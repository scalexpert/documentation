description: On board on the developer portal (API console)
---

# On boarding API

The developer portal is the application to:

* Select your APIs catalog.&#x20;
* Manage your developers merchant's organization
* Declare your [Client Apps](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and get your credentials (Client ID and Secret)&#x20;
* Subscribe to one or many APIs according solutions in your contract.
* Consult your APIs Analytics

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to simplify your on boarding, these steps above would be prepared for you and your API keys credentials ready to use. If so, you will just need to retrieve your API keys credentials by resetting your secret on your developer merchant's organization space created for you.  Go to [**get your API keys**](api-key.md#3-api-key)
{% endhint %}

[^1]: A client App is referring to the merchant server app that would consume the APIs

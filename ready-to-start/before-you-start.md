# ðŸ†• Before you start

Thank you for choosing our solutions! :smile: Now let us guide you  step-by-step and illustrate how you can use and integrate our solutions. But before you start there are some prerequisites and explanations you must understand:

* Our solutions are integrated through APIs and plugins. But in any case you would need to **get your credentials (API keys + secret).** APIs are available on [2 environments](../api-reference/apis-common/api-urls.md): production (PROD) and test (UATC) meaning 2 API keys.&#x20;
* :new: **You can collect your API keys** from a new "developer space" part of the merchant portal!  You will receive an invitation via email to join :envelope\_with\_arrow: as soon your contact is signed.
* To get **your secret** you will need to **reset** it!  (follow next guides below)

### Access your new developer space

{% content-ref url="dev-portal/" %}
[dev-portal](dev-portal/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

That's it!  you are almost ready to start:

* To use the APIs, you must select the use case you want. All the uses cases are described [here](broken-reference).
* To integrate the APIs, you must select your integration mode. All integration mode are described [here](broken-reference).   &#x20;

You are ready then go to "[Get started page](get-started/)" :tada:

# ðŸ†• Before you start

You choose our solutions, thank you ! :smile: Now let us guide you  step-by-step and illustrate how you can use and integrate our solutions. But before you start there are some prerequisites and explanations you must understand:

* Our solutions are integrated through APIs and plugins. But in any case you would need to **get your credentials (API keys + secret).** APIs are available on [2 environments](../api-reference/apis-common/api-urls.md): production (PROD) and test (UATC) meaning 2 API keys.&#x20;
* :new: Your subscription to [APIs](../api-reference/apis-common/) **is now automatically generated after your contract signature !**&#x20;
* [**You can collect your API keys**](../api-reference/apis-common/advanced-features/api-key.md) from the [developer portal.](../api-reference/apis-common/#api-console-developer-portal) To access it make sure you create your account (the procedure to create an account is described [here](../api-reference/apis-common/advanced-features/account-creation.md)). You will receive an invitation to join your "[**developers merchant's organization**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]" (the support team will prepare everything for you but in case of the procedure to onboard the developer portal is described [here](../api-reference/apis-common/advanced-features/on-boarding-api.md)). &#x20;
* **To get your secret you will need to** [**reset**](../api-reference/apis-common/advanced-features/api-key.md#id-4-reset-secret) **it!** (see more details on page [API key](../api-reference/apis-common/advanced-features/api-key.md)).

{% hint style="warning" %}
For security reasons API key secret would be never sent by email. The only way to display it would be at reset operation! Please consult our [security best practices.](../security/security-best-practices.md)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

That's it!  you are almost ready to start:

* To use the APIs, you must select the use case you want. All the uses cases are described [here](broken-reference).
* To integrate the APIs, you must select your integration mode. All integration mode are described [here](broken-reference).   &#x20;

You are ready then go to "[Get started page](get-started/)" :tada:

[^1]: A developer merchant organization created during your on boarding. This organization will manage developers access to the API and keys.

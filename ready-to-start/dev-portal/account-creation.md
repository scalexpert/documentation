{% hint style="warning" %}
Once created, you would need to contact your merchant administrator organization (signatory contract representative merchant people by default) in order to allocate you a "developer role" in the user menu (only accessible by administrator and owner). Without allocation you will not have access to the developer space (unless your are already admin or owner roles) .
{% endhint %}

:rabbit2: Got already your account and role, then next collect your API keys (next step)&#x20;

# Before you start

Goal of this tutorial is to explain step-by-step and illustrate how you can use and integrate the BaaS APIs. But before you start there are some prerequisites and explanations you must understand:

* APIs will be published on production and sandbox environments.
* For subscribing to APIs you will need to have an account. The procedure to create an account is described [here](developers-docs/before-you-start/account-creation.md).
* For subscribing to production APIs you will need to complete your "on boarding" to the developer portal. The procedure for on boarding is described [here](developers-docs/before-you-start/developer-portal-on-boarding.md).
* Your subscription to production APIs will need to be confirmed by the BaaS support team that would verify the validity of your demand according the contract you have signed. Once your subscription is confirmed you are almost ready to start.
* To use the APIs, you must select the use case you want. All the uses cases are described [here](broken-reference).
* To integrate the APIs, you must select your integration mode. All integration mode are described [here](broken-reference).   &#x20;

You are ready then go to "[Get started page](developers-docs/get-started/)"

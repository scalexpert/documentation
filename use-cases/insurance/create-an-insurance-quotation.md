# Create an insurance quotation

In order for your customer to receive a valid quote for an insurance offer price, upon his selection of an offer, you would need to call our Quotation API with the insurance ID which was selected by your client.

You can display the updated quoted price by calling API [`POST /insurance/api/v1/quotations` ](../../api-reference/insurance-api/v-1.2-insurance-api.md#quotations-1)

This will automatically update the price displayed for your customer with a valid quote.

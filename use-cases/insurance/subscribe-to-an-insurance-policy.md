# Subscribe to an insurance policy

Once your client has chosen an insurance offer ans is now about to proceed to checkout, upon his payment process, you would need to call our Insurance Subscription API : `API POST /insurance/api/v1/subscriptions.`&#x20;

If the quote is valid and your client payment goes through, the **subscription will be confirmed.** You can display confirmation of it on your payment confirmation page if you wish to, as we confirm subscription to you. Your client will also **receive a confirmation email directly from our insurance provider**.

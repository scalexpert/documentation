## 3- Financing request statuses

New prestashop order statuses have been created for reflecting the statuses of financing requests:

* Financing request requested
* Financing request initialized
* Financing request pre accepted
* Financing request accepted
* Financing request rejected
* Financing request aborted

See more details in [E-financing solutions life cycle](../../../../use-cases/credit/e-financing-status-life-cycle.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Statuses are collected at different times: after return of financing customer journeys, on periodic basis for asynchronous steps. Some mechanism for requesting statuses are in place (for more details see advanced configuration guide).

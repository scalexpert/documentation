* Manage your developers mechant's organization
* Declare your [Client Apps](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and get your credentials (Client ID and Secret)&#x20;
* Subscribe to one or many APIs according solutions in your contract.
* Consult your APIs Analytics

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to simplify your on boarding, these steps above would be prepared for you and your API keys credentials ready to use. If so, you will just need to retrieve your API keys credentials by reseting your secret on your developer merchant's organization space created for you.  Go to [**get your API keys**](api-key.md#3-api-key)
{% endhint %}

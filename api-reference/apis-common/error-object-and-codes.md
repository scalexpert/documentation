Reply 2xx when request behaves correctly as expected and documented:&#x20;

Code

Message

Semantic

200

OK

Usual OK, also to use for empty list and pagination. Must contain a body.

201

Created

Resource created from a POST, or also a PUT when the identifier can be pre-defined

202

Accepted

Asynch request with further treatment, polling or webhook may be used to get result

204

No content

There is no data to reply so response body is empty (not to use for empty list)

206

Do not use 206 for paging : when client request a page and you return it, you fully replied to its request.

429

Too Many Requests

A quota/throttling logic detected too many requests from client in current period => Client app developer MUST prevent itself to call the API beyond its allowed quota Since the status code may match several use cases you should Use standardized error body to give sufficient information in the response body so the client app developer team can alone understand the issue and correct its code or data.

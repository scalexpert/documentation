# UAT API for partners

{% hint style="warning" %}
UAT APIs are only for partners. Anyone can access the catalog but APIs are protected and need an IP filtering authorization to be reached.

Hi Partners! please access the UAT catalog for API documentation.&#x20;

UAT is internal environment where APIs are tested post-production (future version). APIs can be reached with dedicated urls:

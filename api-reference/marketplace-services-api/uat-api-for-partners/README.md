## 2- Cash management

### **Description**

* The Marketplace Services API is used to execute the payment process from order until the payout.
* It offers the ability to register orders, transactions and then apply order-splits, transfers and payouts.
* Once the order is registered, the marketplace associates the transactions with the order. Then, the marketplace allocates funds to each seller and charges fees through the order-splits endpoint.
* Finally, the marketplace can make payments to the seller's external account or to its own external account.
* The endpoint /transfers provides the ability for the Marketplace to move funds between the seller account and the Marketplace account or vice versa.

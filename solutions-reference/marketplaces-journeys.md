## Developer how-to guides

Follow these step-by-step guides for integrating Marketplace Services flows and seller verification.

The guides include walkthroughs on testing and integrating Marketplace Services features. Refer to the related guides below:

1. Look after the way to connect and use our APIs
   1. [authorization-server-api.md](../api-reference/authorization-server-api.md "mention")
   2. Scope for marketplace is: _marketplace:rw_
   3. You should have a _solutionCode_
2. Integrate the endpoints regarding the onboarding of your sellers
   1. [endpoints-sellers-on-boarding.md](../api-reference/marketplace-services-api/uat-api-for-partners/endpoints-sellers-on-boarding.md "mention")
3. Integrate the remaining endpoints to manage orders and subscriptions

## Glossary

* Merchant: the marketplace itself
* Seller : the company who sells products on the marketplace website.
* Contact : physical person having a relashionship direct or indirect with a seller entity. Also known as UBO (Ultimate Beneficiary Owner)
* Account/Wallet : payment account of the seller or the marketplace
* PAYIN : all money flow regarding incoming cash
* PAYOUT : all money flow regarding outgoing cash
* INTERNAL : all money flow between marketplace and sellers accounts
* KYB: Know Your Business. To simplify, in this document, as we realize assessment on a legal entity and on serveral physical person at the same time, we only use KYC term.

## 1 - Prerequisite: the Marketplace onboarding

First of all, we assume that you are onboarded and have an acces to the merchant portal.

## 2 - Seller on boarding and [KYC](marketplaces-journeys.md#glossary)

First of all, to start working with Marketplace Services, you have to integrate a set of endpoints to onboard your sellers. These endpoint are designed to support the onboarding in multiple-times without having to save any sensitive data on your side. The objectives of this step is to ensure that your sellers are compliant with regulation rules.

### 2.1 - Onboarding & KYC endpoints

### 2.2 - Onboarding & KYC journey

![](../.gitbook/assets/8.png)  **Objective: launch the KYC review of a seller**

As a marketplace you need to onboard sellers with your back-office. You will have to request to your sellers to complete all datas requested for kyc in the seller onboarding API. Each time a new data is filled, you can use the appropriate endpoint to store the values filled. Your seller will be able to fill requested informations in multiple times without loosing any data.

{% hint style="warning" %}
During the onboarding only, the solution is designed to allow the marketplace to use his own ID to manage the sellers in the scaleXpert environement. After the onboarding, a ScaleXpert "_sellerId_" will be used.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For an existing seller, the marketplace make a KYC renewal for the seller. Some fields already known by the marketplace and could be pre-filled.
{% endhint %}

```



At any time, as a Markeplace, you can retreive all informations already provided with the GET /sellers/{merchantSellerId}. This endpoint gives you all informations, documents and contacts sent previously except the document itself (for security reason).

You can also use other http verbs to manage each party (GET/PATCH/DELETE). See [#id-2.1-onboarding-and-kyb-endpoints](marketplaces-journeys.md#id-2.1-onboarding-and-kyb-endpoints "mention") for full possibilities.

### 2.3 - Onboarding rules and other explanations

**2.3.2 The contacts**&#x20;

After the seller creation, the marketplace must add all the contacts required. Contacts to be added are all the direct and indirect owner of the seller. Contacts are only _physical person_.

{% hint style="info" %}
To know the criterias of an Ultimate Beneficiary Owner (UBO) of a company: [RBE\_Fiche\_pratique\_schemas (greffe-tc-paris.fr)](https://www.greffe-tc-paris.fr/uploads/paris/Fiches%20RCS/RBE_Fiche_pratique_schemas.pdf)

  * The value of monthly revenue of the contact
* `taxResidenceCountryCode`
  * The country where the contact pay taxes
* `taxResidenceTaxPayerId`
  * The unique reference of the contact as tax-payer delivered by the country above



**2.3.3 The documents**

To be realized, the KYC required some documents to proof identity of the company and of each added contacts. It is mandatory to upload at least one document per seller and one document per contact to launch the KYC review process.&#x20;

Documents rules:

* A document cannot be updated but only added or deleted
* A document is never given back. One way only. Not present in a GET answer.
* A document has restricted extensions and size (see Swagger for details)
* For the Seller, minimum mandatory is the `COMPANY_REGISTRATION` proof

Documents fields:

* `name`
  * The name of the document with the extension included
* `fileContent`
  * The base64encoded document
* `type`
  * The category of the document

### 2.4 - Launch the KYC

Once you have filled all the required fields, added all contacts (at least one) according company owner rules, and added at least one document for the company and one per contact, you are able to call the `/_assess-kyc` endpoint.

This request succeed only when sellers and contacts status are COMPLETE or VALIDATED

To verify that you can request a KYC validation, you can use the GET sellers/{merchantSellerId} endpoint. This endpoint retreive all the data and document already provided and give a status on them. You will have a structure like this:

* **seller**
  * documents
    * status (REGISTERED, PENDING\_VALIDATION, VALIDATED, REFUSED)
  * dataStatus (COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, PENDING\_VALIDATION, VALIDATED)
  * documentListStatus (COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, PENDING\_VALIDATION, VALIDATED)
  * **contacts**
    * documents
      * status (REGISTERED, PENDING\_VALIDATION, VALIDATED, REFUSED)
    * dataStatus (COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, PENDING\_VALIDATION, VALIDATED)
    * documentListStatus (COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE, PENDING\_VALIDATION, VALIDATED)

The seller (Legal entity) and each contacts (physical person) have both 3 status:

* Status regarding the completion of their data
* Status regarding uploaded documents
* Status regarding the number of document uploaded

When all status are COMPLETE and REGISTERED, you are able to the first call of `/_assess-kyc` endpoint.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (7).svg" alt="Launch kyc process" class="gitbook-drawing">

Then, the endpoints are locked until the KYC review is done.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
An other way to know what data are missing is to look after the list provided when calling the PUT /sellers.

For example:

```json
{
  "dataStatus": "INCOMPLETE",
  "missingData": [
    "email",
    "phoneNumber",
    "legalFormAcronym",
    "legalEntityCapitalizationAmount",
    "legalEntityCapitalizationCurrency",
    "businessActivity",
    "businessActivity.typeCode",
    "legalAnnualTurnover",
    "bankingInformation",
    "bankingInformation.accountName",
    "bankingInformation.iban",
    "bankingInformation.bic",
    "bankingInformation.currency"
  ]
}
```
{% endhint %}



### 2.5 - The IBAN verification

To realize the KYC, as additional mesure, we have to receive a fund transfer of 1â‚¬ from the bank account of the seller. To do this, we associate for each KYC process one unique IBAN dedicated per seller. A few minutes after requesting KYC, a WebHook `MP_IBAN_AVAILABLE_FOR_PAYMENT` will be sent and the IBAN will be available on the seller endpoint.&#x20;

In the GET /sellers/{merchantSellerId} answer body, there is the field:

* `identityVerification`
  * `virtualIban`
    * `iban`
      * The IBAN beneficiary of the 1â‚¬ transfer&#x20;
    * `bic`
      * The BIC associated with the IBAN above
    * `type`
      * The only way supported today is VIRTUAL\_IBAN

This IBAN is to be send to the seller to finalize the KYC submission. The KYC will not be analyzed (and will not be validated) until the fund transfer of 1â‚¬ is not received. This fund transfer can be either in a classical SCT (2 or 3 days to be received) or Instant SCT (10 seconds to be received). This transfer MUST be realized from the account of the seller (opened with the name of the company).

{% hint style="info" %}
The 1â‚¬ sent are loosed for the seller if the KYC is definitively refused (specific use cases).
{% endhint %}



### 2.6 - KYC in progress

As soon as the 1â‚¬ transfer will be received, you will be notified by the `MP_KYC_IN_PROGRESS` webhook. It means that an operator will check all the information provided for this seller and to give a status within the next 48 hours. Then you will receive either an approval `MP_KYC_VALIDATED` or a refusal `MP_KYC_REFUSED`.

### 2.7 - KYC refused

If the webhook received is a `MP_KYC_REFUSED`, you have to ask to the seller to make changes.&#x20;

Here are the different status (requesting a GET /sellers/{merchantSellerId} you can have, and the change to be done.

#### 2.7.1 Documents

* `documents.status`  is now `REFUSED`
  * Look after the field `kycReviewComment` to know the reason and upload a new one if needed
*   `contact.documents.status`  is now `REFUSED`

    * Look after the field contact.kycReviewComment to know the reason and upload a new one if needed





<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (2).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

#### 2.7.2 Contacts

* `contacts.dataStatus` is now `INCOMPLETE`
  * One or more fields are to be changed because of some wrong or incoherent values. More informations are given on the `contacts.kycReviewComment` field



<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (1).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

#### 2.7.3 Sellers

* `dataStatus` is now `INCOMPLETE`
  * One or more fields are to be changed because of some wrong or incoherent values. More informations are given on the `kycReviewComment` field
  * One or more effective beneficiary (contacts) are missing. In this case, the `kycReviewComment` field will also be used to ask to create the missing contacts.



<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw.svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">



### 2.8 - Submit KYC again

After the requested change are made: new documents uploaded or data changed, a new request "/_assess-kyc"_ should be called. Then, the different status are again in `PENDING_VALIDATION` and any change is again blocked during 48 hours to be verified.



<img src="../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (3).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

### 2.9 - Webhooks

During the onboarding process, you will receive webhooks at each step of onboarding to follow the completion without having to pull GET requests every minute.

For the complete list, see the dedicated page : [Webhook table](../api-reference/merchant-webhooks-api/webhook-event-types.md#solution-marketplace-services-event-types) of Marketplace Services.

And to manage your webhooks subscriptions, go there:&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before your first seller onboarding, make sure you realized the webhook intergration otherwise you will not be able to follow the onboarding process steps correctly.
{% endhint %}

#### 2.9.1 Overwiew of webhooks during the onboarding process

First you have to complete requested data described in the previous chapter, then you make your first call to the endpoint /_assess-kyc._ A few time after, you will receive the webhook MP\_IBAN\_AVAILABLE\_FOR\_PAYMENT. This webhook is sent only once.

Then, as soon as the 1â‚¬ are receveived on the IBAN, you will receive the webhook MP\_KYC\_IN\_PROGRESS. THis webhook means that the data and documents will be controled soon.

Then, if the kyc is validated, you will receive the final webhook MP\_KYC\_VALIDATED.\
Otherwise, you will receive a MP\_KYC\_REFUSED webhook. As soon as you request a new assess-kyc (after changes made on documents or data that are refused or incomplete), you will aain receive a MP\_KYC\_IN\_PROGRESS webhook and a MP\_KYC\_VALIDATED or MP\_KYC\_REFUSED.

In this diagram, you can follow the webhooks workflow:

\==================================================================

## 3 - Workflow management journey

Now, your marketplace is ready to process orders checkouts. Each part of financial flow must be notified to Scalexpert:

* orders (creation, delete, change...)
* transactions (linked to an order)
* splits (to dispatch amount of an order to serveral sellers)
* payouts (to send amount on external bank accounts)
* transfers (to make movments between seller and marketplace)

### 3.1 - Workflow management endpoints

### 3.2 - Orders

#### 3.2.1 Rules&#x20;

* Considering that the marketplace has a minimum of one seller (with KYC validated), it can start to register orders.
* Each time the marketplace register a new order, a notification must be sent to MS. Orders are the entry point of all following steps. It is required for MS to manage accounting part for proposing all value-added features.
* On the MS side, the minimum required field for an order is the amount, but some extra info could be great to provide. The amount of an order has no impact on accouning part of MS. Only **transactions amounts** are considered.
* Order amounts are used for reporting. So to have an accurate reporting, use the patch verb in case of orders amount change (cancelled item in an order for example).

#### 3.2.2 Fields&#x20;

Main fields to register an order are:

* `merchantGlobalOrderId`
  * Id of the order in the operator system
* `amount`
  * total amount of the order
* `merchantBuyerId`
  * Id of the buyer in the operator system

#### 3.2.3 Webhooks&#x20;

There is no specific webhook relative to orders creation or update. But in case of a new transaction linked to an unkown order, Marketplace Services send automatically an "order.notFound" webhook to notify the marketplace that an order creation is needed.

| **WebHook name**      | **Trigger**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MP\_ORDER\_NOT\_FOUND | each time a transaction refers an order that has not be created before in MS, this webhook is sent to notify the marketplace that MS doesnâ€™t know this order. The marketplace should then make a PATCH order to update the order amount. |

### 3.3 - Transactions

#### **3.3.1 Rules**&#x20;

* All PAYIN are related/linked to a transaction
* A transaction is related to an order
* A transaction is an accountable operation A transaction can be PAID or not

* A transaction can be for the benefit of the marketplace: PAYMENT or for the benefit of the buyer: REFUND and CREDIT
* The source of a transaction is from a known payment method (PSP, APM, SCT, etc.)&#x20;
* A transaction can have a due date
  * If so, a specific webhook will be generated when the dueDate is reached but not paid&#x20;
* No limits regarding number of transactions attached to a single order
* The amount field must be > 0
* A transaction REFUND cannot be registered before a transaction PAYMENT on the same orderId.

#### 3.3.2 Fields&#x20;

Main fields of a transaction are:

* `merchantGlobalOrderId`
  * Id of the order in the operator system the transactions refers
* `merchantTransactionId`
  * Id of the transaction in the operator system
* `amount`
  * amount of the transaction
* `type`
  * PAYMENT or REFUND or CREDIT

  * The payment method used for the transaction. Will be used by marketplace services to reconciliate the transaction.
* `dueDate`
  * Optional field used to be notified (dedicated webhook) in case of non-payment from the buyer to launch a recovery process.



#### 3.3.3 Webhooks&#x20;

| **WebHook name**        | **Trigger**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MP\_ORDER\_NOT\_FOUND   | each time a transaction refers an order that has not be created before in MS, this webhook is sent to notify the marketplace that MS doesnâ€™t know this order. The marketplace should then make a PATCH order to update the order amount.                              |
| MP\_TRANSACTION\_UPDATE | <p>each time the field paidAmount of a transaction is updated, this webhook is sent to notify the markeptlace</p><p>each time the dueDate of a transaction is reached, and the paidAmount is not equals to amount, this webhook is sent to notify the markeptlace</p> |

### 3.4 - OrderSplit

#### **3.4.1 Rules**&#x20;

* An orderSplit create an INTERNAL movment of funds
* An orderSplit is used to dispatch amounts from transactions it can be called one time or many time.
* Each new call (for the same ORDER) is cumulative with previous calls.
* An orderSplit realize a fund movement. It is the link between amounts collected in PAYIN and the PAYOUT
* If the transactions are not cashed (money is not settled), these operations between CANTONMENT account and SELLERS accounts are stored as previsional.
* It is not possible to split an amount GREATER than the cumulated amount of transactions attached to the order considered
* &#x20;In the order, transactions can be PAID or not, it doesnâ€™t affect the result
* In a logic way, at the end of the day (when the full order is sent), the full amount of transactions must be splitted.
* If a refund occurs, the orderSplit can be used to call back the money of a seller and to give back marketplace fees to this seller.

#### 3.4.2 Fields&#x20;

Main fields of an orderSplit are:

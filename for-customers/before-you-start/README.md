# Before you start

You choose our solutions, thank you ! :smile: Now let guide you  step-by-step and illustrate how you can use and integrate our solutions. But before you start there are some prerequisites and explanations you must understand:

* Our solutions are integrated through APIs and plugins. But in any case you would need to **subscribe to APIs and get your credentials (API keys + secret).**
* APIs are available on 2 environments: production and test. For subscribing to APIs **you will need to have an customer account.** The procedure to create an account is described [here](account-creation.md).
* **For subscribing to production APIs** you will need to complete your "[customer on boarding](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]" and get access to the developer portal with your "[**developers merchant's organization**](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]". The support team will prepare for you everything but in case of the procedure to onboard the developer portal is described [here](on-boarding-api.md). Once your subscription is confirmed you are almost ready to start.
* To use the APIs, you must select the use case you want. All the uses cases are described [here](broken-reference).
* To integrate the APIs, you must select your integration mode. All integration mode are described [here](broken-reference).   &#x20;

You are ready then go to "[Get started page](../get-started/)"

[^1]: Once your contract signed, an onboarding process will be handle by our sales support to activate your solutions in sandbox and production environments. &#x20;

[^2]: A developer merchant organization will be created during your on boarding. This organization will manage developers access to the API and keys.
